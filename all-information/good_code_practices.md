# Good Code Practices
- **Up to date:** Make sure your code is up to date by pulling from the default branch
    git pull origin main
- **No directly editing main branch:** NEVER edit in the main branch
    - Instead, create a branch, then switch to it
        - git checkout -b name/issue
            - Example: git checkout -b allison/files
        - git switch name/issue
            - Example: git switch allison/files
- **Push changes ONLY to your branch:** Add, commit, push
    - git add "file-path"
        - Example: git add "src/app/home/page.js"
        - To ensure the path is correct, see if it's nested under any folders (and if it is, make sure to include the folder in the file path)
    - git commit -m "Commit message here"
        - Example: git commit -m "Add header component to render for every page"
    - git push origin name/issue
        - Example: git push origin allison/files
- **Create a pull request:** On GitHub, go to the pull requests tab on the GitHub repository
    - Select the branch you want to merge with main
    - Link the pull request with the issue you were assigned
    - Add 2 reviewers - Allison (allison-pham) and Annie (annlee1226)
    - Wait for Allison and Annie to merge your pull request with the main branch
